AgentForceRevOpsSalesGeneralSaahil DhakaFeb 28 20235 minsAre you a sales manager tired of basing your teams success solely on the end result Are you ready to shift your focus from just the numbers to the efforts that lead to those numbers Look no further In this blog well show you how modern revenue intelligence can power your sales training by identifying leading indicators such as the rep booking the most meetings and the rep with the most positive sentiment in their emails Say goodbye to the guesswork and hello to effective coaching techniques that drive long-term success Ready to join the effort-over-results revolution Keep readingWhat are the leading indicatorsLeading indicators in sales and revenue operations provide insight into a companys future performance They are often used to predict future trends and identify areas for improvement Some leading indicators in sales include the number of appointments set per week the number of calls made per day and the quality of customer relationships that can be measured through sentiment on calls and emails In revenue operations leading indicators may include the efficiency of the sales process the speed at which deals are closed the number of upsell opportunities and the pipeline generated for the current and next quartersBy tracking these leading indicators companies can identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent when focusing only on lagging indicators such as revenue or profits This allows them to make data-driven decisions and take proactive steps to improve performanceIts important to note that leading indicators are not a crystal ball â they are simply tools to help guide decision-making and identify areas for improvement Utilizing leading and lagging indicators can give a well-rounded view of a sales teamâs performance and help drive long-term success So go ahead and embrace your inner data nerd â your teamand company will thank youFrom dashboards to data stories and beyondâMost sales managers have some form of a dashboard built on either BI tools or existing CRM solutions These are limited to overall KPIs and metrics such as conversion rates at different stages or numbers of closed-wonlost deals Even though these dashboards are effective in understanding the overall state of the pipeline but ineffective in breaking down reasons for the current state or areas where the pipeline can be optimized Using leading indicators it can be quite clear why deals may fall out of the pipeline Take an example of a company that sells to the pharmaceutical industry and small European manufacturers Over 30 of their reps were not adequately trained to sell to large pharma companies but 5 were exceptional at selling to small manufacturers The regional sales manager realized this by understanding the effort this 30 were putting in and areas for improvement She soon realized that most had below-average sentiment on calls when handling simple objections from pharma companies Using this newfound information from leading indicators she quickly re-assigned them to the small manufacturer sales teams where they saw conversions going up by 15 Its important to use these leading indicators to understand the buyers journey and identify which teams or reps are most successful in specific geographies or with certain customer profiles For example if it takes an average of 8 meetings to close a deal with a large software company with multiple decision makers analyzing your teams sentiment and performance with each decision maker can reveal which reps are most effective at handling objections from each individual This information can be invaluable in coaching and improving the overall performance of your team Build similar stories for each of your teams and use the practices from the most successful reps to benchmark performance and create a culture of data-driven decision-makingHow can Revenue Operations and Intelligence platforms helpLooking for a way
