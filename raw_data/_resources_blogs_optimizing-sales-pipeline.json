actual purchase It is client-focused in that it considers the many steps a customer will take to make a purchaseA sales funnel is for leads whereas a sales pipeline is for dealsEvery step a sales representative takes to complete a deal from beginning to end is referred to as a sales pipelineConversely a sales funnel consists of the steps the lead goes through in the purchasing process before
