AgentForceSalesSalesforceGeneralSaahil DhakaJul 26 20228 minsAssume youre closing deals rapidlyâyou should be able to meet your monthly quota But what about the following month Consistency is essential in sales You wont be able to predict your sales for tomorrow let alone next month or quarter if you dont have a framework for successful salesWhat is Sales Cycle and why is it importantA sales cycle is the repeatable and tactical process that salespeople use to convert leads into customers It also assist you in replicating your success or determining how to improveincluding everything from the first contact with the prospect to the contract signing The length of sales cycles varies depending on the industry business and product but the sales process generally follows a consistent pattern and aligns with several clearly defined sales cycle stages In addition to defining each stage its critical to keep track of how much time each customer spends in each stage as well as the overall length of the sales cycle The timing of these events can reveal how efficient your revenue operations processes are and provide you with a benchmark against which you can compare yourselfBusinesses with a formal sales cycle process can grow their revenue by 18 more For your salespeople team to succeed you need clearly defined sales cycle stages and goalsAssume you discover that your sales cycle is twice as long as that of your competitors that is it takes you twice as long to make a sale To figure out why examine each step of the sales process from lead generation to objection handling You may then review stage-by-stage conversion rates to see at which points leads are dropping off If it appears that leads are leaving after you give a sales presentation for example its time to hone your presentation skills or revise your messageB2B vs B2C Sales CycleYoull need to stay on top of your sales cycle whether youre selling to businesses or consumersâbut each can look very different B2C and B2B sales cycles necessitate varying amounts of time product knowledge and communication Here are a few key distinctions between the twoDuration of the decision-making process When selling to individuals the time between when it occurs to them to buy something and when they purchase your product can be quite short Of course this isnt always the case especially if youre selling something expensive like a car but in many cases buyers will pick your product off the shelf walk out with it and forget about it That is not the case when selling to businesses Before making a sale the sales cycle may include several months of meetings pitches presentations emailing back and forth and persuading all stakeholdersNumber of stakeholders When selling to a single consumer you only need to persuade one person to buy your product or service When selling to businesses that number can quickly grow For example if you are selling software you may need to persuade the CFO the CEO or any number of people on the finance or marketing teamAvailable leads B2C sales have far more potential leads than B2B sales because there are far more people than companies Because there are fewer leads to choose from in a B2B context learning about your audienceâthe specific types of businesses your product or service is meant to helpâis even more important You must emphasize how your product or service benefits each business rather than just a hypothetical customer persona To adequately answer all of the questions you pose you may need to have in-depth knowledge of what youre sellingMake sure to account for these differences in your sales cycle and budget for much longer lead times in B2B situations or you may run out of cashStages of Sales CycleThere are typically 6 stages of a sales cycle but remember that not every sale or customer interaction will follow the same path 1 ProspectingIt is also known as finding potential new customers is the first stage of the sales cycle During this stage members of your sales and marketing teams will need to delve into the unique value proposition of the product or service youre selling and identify potential audiences who can benefit from your offerings This stage may also include the results of lead generation For example perhaps youve received inquiries about your product or service via your website These inquiries should be treated as leads2 Qualifying leadsAfter youve identified your prospects the next step is to contact them The communication channel you select will be determined by the nature of your business or prospect In this stage you are not giving your full sales pitch but rather making contact with potential clients in the hopes of setting up a more formal meeting3 PitchingDemoThis is the most important stage of the sales cycle and requires the most planning You should strive to present your goods or services in such a way that they solve a problem for the customer Prepare to show how using your product will improve your customers day-to-day operations and how your company does this better than anyone elseRemember that youre also selling yourself during this presentation so things like body language mannerisms and even your appearance can impact a sale4 NegotiationAt this point in the sales cycle your job is to manage and overcome any objections Even the most enthusiastic prospects will have reservations or objectionsâthe price is too high the contract is too narrow or the terms are unsuitable Dont be afraid to ask for clarification on their objections Is their hesitation due to a previous issue or interaction Are they still carrying reservations from a failed business deal Listen to what the client has to say patiently and let them know you understand their concerns Reframe your pitch to address and overcome those concernsConsider reframing the information in a shorter breakdowns if the price is causing concern For example if your software service costs around 200 per month you can reposition it as just over 6 per day Thats less than the price of a fancy nonfat extra-shot vanilla latte5 Closing StageIts now time to close the deal The closing stage of the sales cycle is when you either win or lose the sale Remember that just because the prospect isnt ready to sign the deal after the first meeting doesnt mean it cant be done A yes may require several meetings email exchanges or other contactsOnce the sale is complete ask the customer if they have any contacts who might be interested in your product Its also an excellent time to outline and reinforce the customer journey to position yourself for successful contract renewals and expansion opportunities in the future6 Nurture StageEven after the deal is closed it is critical to invest time in your new customer You will not only strengthen customer loyalty but you will also increase the likelihood of an upsell or referral Here are some ideas for nurturing the new relationshipTo ensure a smooth handoff ensure a smooth onboarding process between account managers and new customersSpeak with marketing to determine what content your new customers might find useful as they use the product or service and send valuable resources such as how-to guides and demosEvery one to three months contact your customer and ask how you can assist themOptimize your sales cycleReduce work with little added valueA typical salesperson spends only 36 of their time selling and the rest is on administrative tasks Your employees can easily outsource their service tasks and focus on sales to improve your sales cycleCarry out follow-ups carefullyUnfortunately lead generation can be time-consuming And as previously stated most sales require follow-ups before a deal is closed That is why your salespeople must develop the habit of perseverance in their activitiesAsk for small commitmentsA foot-in-the-door technique can help you establish a stronger connection with your prospects With this strategy you ask for one small favor after another until they agree to close the dealBegin by asking for the clients phone numbers when you contact them via email After going through a product demonstration request that the product be introduced to their purchasing teamUse Social ProofCase studies are ideal for providing social proof Your employees should actively share them with their leads to move the sale forward Case studies can also be used to counter your leads objectionsFor example they may be concerned that your product will require extensive familiarization Use case studies from other customers to demonstrate how quickly the tool can be implementedTrain Your TeamCreate all the sales documents necessary to guide your team through the sales cycle process Keep an eye on each team members metrics Certain employees may experience difficulties at various stages of the sales cycle If this is the case provide them with additional resources and support from high-performing salespeopleSupplement a Sales Cycle with a Service CycleTo meet the growing importance of service and customer care more and more businesses are beginning to incorporate a service cycle into their sales cycle The cycles must be coordinated or synchronized in this caseShare onCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human
