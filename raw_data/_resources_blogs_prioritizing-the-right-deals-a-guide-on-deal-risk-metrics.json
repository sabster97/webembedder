cut it Itâs natural for managers to expect their reps to convert all the deals which are easy to convert But are they really able to perform that way Deal Prioritization can be the solution that you are looking forWhat is Deal PrioritizationNot every deal in your pipeline should be given equal attention high-growth companies tend to lose many deals which they could have converted as they donât prioritize converting deals in time In the high-ticket SaaS market where the pipeline conversion rate is just around 5 prioritization is a need not an option Focussing on the deals which are likely to convert and respectively reallocate resources to get the best value out of the sales pipeline is Deal Prioritization It can be done on the basis of various metrics depending on the organization The best way could be to design and analyze a risk-scoring mechanism for the deals and based on the same create a priority queue with high-conversion deals on the top How to Prioritize dealsMany sales metrics can be used to rank the deals followed by the creation of a priority queue Most importantly the metrics should always depict the risk associated with the deals no matter how big the deal amount is high-risk deals should never be prioritized as that would just be a waste of resources Here are some important metrics you should always consider while assigning risk scores to the dealsProspect Responsiveness This metric enables us to see if a prospect is responding to emails and whether or not meetings have been planned It is an important metric as unresponsive prospects may

should not be a deciding factor while setting up the priority queue there is no denying the fact that it still is an important metric Rather than just making a queue with a descending trend of deal
