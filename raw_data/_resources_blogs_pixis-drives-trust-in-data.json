Tracktable and the Clientell Revenue Operations platform Tracktable is a chrome plugin that incentivizes data entry by making it a habit instead of a task by bringing salesforce to LinkedIn and spreadsheetsTracktable would provide the in-line edit feature where fields to be updated in an opportunity were adjacent to the opportunity You could update the data with a couple of clicks which would immediately reflect in salesforce This meant the multiple steps in Salesforce would be reduced to a maximum of 2-3 steps to enter data like the experience of editing a spreadsheet making it much easier for reps and AEsAdd to this the Clientell Revenue Intelligence platformâs powerful AI which would extract data from the notes entered in the CRM calendar email inboxes conversation intelligence software if any and other third-party data sources This would add up to 30 more data into the CRM and add over 3000 lost contacts This combination built an efficient data entry process giving reps and AEs more time to focus on selling They were happier and the results were much better regarding their mental peace and involvement with their jobOf course remember the primary outcome was a better forecast meeting every week where nothing was being guessed anymore âWhy didnât we do this earlierâ said Hari when the Clientell team went to him for feedbackTracktable made data entry more effortless and the Clientell platformâs AI efficiently extracted data freeing up repsâ and AEsâ time Clientell now sits on top of Salesforce at Pixis improving data hygiene manifoldShare onCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachGet a free consultationCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachGet a free consultationSuggested BlogsSuggested BlogsSalesforce Consulting Partners How to Find The OneJan 17 2023Salesforce Consulting Partners How to Find The OneJan 17 2023Salesforce Consulting Partners How to Find The OneJan 17 2023Successful Salesforce Implementation ChecklistJan 17 2023Successful Salesforce Implementation ChecklistJan 17 2023Successful Salesforce Implementation ChecklistJan 17 2023Salesforce Implementation PlaybookJan 17 2023Salesforce Implementation PlaybookJan 17 2023Salesforce Implementation PlaybookJan 17 2023",
