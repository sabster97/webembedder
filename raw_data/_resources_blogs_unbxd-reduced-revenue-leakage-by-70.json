Tracktable and the Clientell Revenue Intelligence platform Tracktable is a Chrome plugin that incentivizes data entry by turning it into a habit rather than a work by integrating Salesforce with LinkedIn and spreadsheetsTracktable would provide an in-line edit function where fields to be edited in an opportunity were adjacent to the opportunity allowing you to adjust the date with a few clicks which would immediately reflect into salesforceThis meant that the various steps required to enter data in Salesforce would be reduced to a maximum of 2-3 steps similar to the experience of changing a spreadsheet making it much easier for reps and AEsAdd to that the Clientell Revenue Intelligence platforms sophisticated AI which would extract data from CRM notes calendars email inboxes conversation intelligence software and other third-party data sources This would result in 30 more data in the CRM and the addition of nearly 3000 deleted contactsThis combination resulted in an efficient data input method and more time for reps and AEs to focus on selling With data in place projections improved as did deal awarenessReps and managers could now work more efficiently using software that provided accurate information allowing them to aim and convert more effectively maximizing revenue and avoiding leakageDeal RoomsClientells virtual Deal Rooms provided a powerful solution to the dilemma of an inefficient view and the lack of a single source of truthThe Clientell Revenue Intelligence Platforms Opportunities page displays all active deals in a logical and easy-to-understand manner Each deal has its deal room where all analytics activity and insights are visualized in a single collaborative platform This in effect is like a virtual deal room Visualize thisOn the platform whoever owns the transaction creates an opportunity The opportunity may belong to an SDR but be acquired by a specific product manager for feature requests and then passed on to a specific customer success executiveWhen the view is opened it shows what has happened with the opportunity over time The prospect engagement window displays which meetings have occurred or will occur which emails have been sent and received and at what stage the communication occurred To shorten ramp time managers can examine objections and use winning opportunities to train incoming reps using real-life scenariosAs a result visibility improves because everything is conveniently available on a single page This makes it much easier for all stakeholders to know whats going on in the opportunity and the process of dealing with it becomes much smootherIf the manager believes that a deal should be molded included amended excluded or passed on he can readily communicate with the owner using this Whatever dialogue takes place is available to everyone who is involvedWith such a comprehensive view and efficient flow of complete information between various stakeholders decisions regarding deals are no more arbitrary but confidently taken helping optimize revenue and preventing unnecessary leakageShare onCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachGet a free consultationCut Salesforce Admin Costs by 70 with AI  Human ApproachGet a free consultationSuggested BlogsSuggested BlogsUnbxd Running Efficient Forecast CallsJan 9 2023Unbxd Running Efficient Forecast CallsJan 9 2023Unbxd Running Efficient Forecast CallsJan 9 2023Pixis reduces RevOps team costs by 27Jan 9 2023Pixis reduces RevOps team costs by 27Jan 9 2023Pixis reduces RevOps team costs by 27Jan 9 2023Pixis Accelerates pipeline with ClientellJan 9 2023Pixis Accelerates pipeline with ClientellJan 9 2023Pixis Accelerates pipeline with ClientellJan 9 2023",
